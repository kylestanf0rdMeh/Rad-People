-- disable onpress mobile highlghts (it makes a onpress event that highlights the selected thing blue)
-- Fix event details so that it never shows whitespace, the event title can clip off the screen if too long, it does not wrap properly. Also, the descritption needs to be dynamic and show the entire thing without scroll for UX purposes. This is all on mobile.
-- Mobile events page has a bug on the past events where each transition of a video will make the margin between each event grow. Very strange
-- Make the events title glitch text in using the library.
-- perhaps enhance the navbar.
-- about page on mobile will split text if it has a location in it. Needs to be fixed.
-- make take away all react router dom elements and use hrefs so that the page scroll starts at the top.
-- host backend on AWS ec2. Also could take a look at server config to ensure the thing has enogh worker threads and supports concurrency.
